DEF CON 22 - Dr. Paul Vixie - Domain Name Problems and Solutions-  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5D4wssff0jg




The definition the speaker gives about what the internet is is from Seth Bart. DNS lets anyone look up a "<domain, type>". 90% is low when it comes to domain names according to to the speaker, the creation rate is a lot higher. He also discusses nonconsensual and consensual comunication. How those of us who want to enjoy consensual comunication online, need to combat security companies that may feel that nonconsensual access may be beneficial to them. However these same companies also can get rid of a virus in an hour. They've create a system now where they will give you an account, and put in your high value complaint against a domain name. If they find through their investigation that yes they are a threat "they will nuke them. And be happy to do this because they know those people will just be back to buy another one." 

It was an interesting video. I definatly will have to look more into the subject.
